# personalstack: an Azure setup for the home office

_If you don't understand why you might need this, then you probably don't need this_

The tools in this repo are used in my home office, aka 'The Command Center'. I'm a tech enthusiast who likes to build things in my free time, and I also consult on how to build connected, data driven systems. I'll keep the documents on how to build in this repository.

## My goal is to have a home computer system that is:
* Completely owned by me
* I control the data, and where it goes
* Extensible
* Free (minus the cloud compute costs, no PaaS subscriptions otuside of Azure)
    * I may consider having a 100% local version of this at some time.
    * Hosting costs should be kept in the ~$20-$30 range.
